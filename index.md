## Research Interests

LI, Jin-Yang (李锦阳) is a Ph.D. candidate from <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/cee/"> CEE </a> @ <a href="https://polyu.edu.hk/"> PolyU</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://songyezhu.wixsite.com/mysite">Prof. Songye ZHU </a>.

My research interests are:
1. Electromagnetic damper
2.






His research focuses on: <br><br>
(1) Development of advanced experimental techniques for characterization of innovative and sustainable materials and structures, <br>
(2) Autonomous rapid damage assessment techniques based on latest structural health monitoring sensing technologies, and <br>
(3) Artificial intelligence solutions such as machine learning, computer vision, and big data analytics used for off-line high-performance modeling and simulation, and long-term prognosis of slow evolving but accumulating damage.
