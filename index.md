## Research Interests

<font color=black size=3> Dr. LI, Jin-Yang (李锦阳) is currently a PostDoc working with <a href="https://songyezhu.wixsite.com/mysite">Prof. Songye ZHU</a>.
He obtained both his Bachalor (2014) and Ph.D. degrees (2020) from <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/cee/"> CEE </a> @ <a href="https://polyu.edu.hk/"> PolyU </a>.


His research focuses on: <br>
(1) Development of advanced experimental techniques for characterization of innovative and sustainable materials and structures, <br>
(2) Autonomous rapid damage assessment techniques based on latest structural health monitoring sensing technologies, and <br>
(3) Artificial intelligence solutions such as machine learning, computer vision, and big data analytics used for off-line high-performance modeling and simulation, and long-term prognosis of slow evolving but accumulating damage.
